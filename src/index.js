// module for chess board
// 8x8 chess board using 2D coordinates [x,y]

/*

1. Put together a script that creates a 
game board and a knight.

2. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as 
children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. 
Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.

4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path 
between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. 
Output what that full path looks like. For example: 

knightMoves([3,3], [4,3])
===> you made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
[3,3]
[4,5]
[2,4]
[4,3]
